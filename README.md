# website
hello, this is my first github repository and also the project that kind of got me into programming. i used a lot of chatgpt in the beginning, but did most of the work myself. 
it features a pretty unique form design that i came up with. you can't really send anything though. also, the nav bar doesn't do anything very interesting either.
